# How this works?

* we start a quiz and get the answers
* there is a bug on nahad website, when you select an option to a question, the API tells you if the selection answer is the correct answer!
* so now you know what option is the answer. you just need to submit it. Boom, you are considered a genius in the class :D

# Usage
just do ```python fucknahad.py```

# API Examples
API Response examples are located in `apiExamples` directory.
